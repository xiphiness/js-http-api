remaining work:
- support json and noun modes side-by-side
  - should add tests for json mode, mixing mode in subscriptions vs scry, etc
- detect & handle 401 response for expired cookie
- consider .onConnectionStatusChange callback (so lazy devs don't have to listen to the event emitter thing)
- optional channel id param
  - so we can re-use the same channel for a client
- do pre-release
  - move client to use new version of the library in json mode
  - use noun scry/poke for new things
  - upgrade existing scries to get nouns, port conversions to js
- do webterm migration stream/recording
